Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7
* Globus Online API
* iRODS icommands
* grid-proxy-utils (in particular grid-proxy-init)
* python-m2crypto (script version > 1.1)[1]
* myproxy commands (in particular myproxy-init)

[1] You also should replace the file m2.py installed with the GO API with 
    a new one, available on the SVN (see below).

Installation
------------

* download all the needed files (see list below) from the official SVN 
* install globus online api, for example:
  $ pip install globusonline-transfer-api-client
* configure your irods environment in order to point to the iRODS server enabled 
  with the needed rules


The script consists of the following files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* datastagerconfig.py.example template for the required (cp to) datastagerconfig.py file (script >1.1)
* PIDselecter.r the rule which gives you the PID of a file given its URL
* URLselecter.r the rule which gives you the URL of a file given its PID

* datastager.py the main script
* datamover.py the script which invokes GO 

* example some concrete example
* pid.file.example an example of PID file, i.e. a list of PIDs (to be used with -PF option)
* task.file.example an example of path file, i.e. a list of file names (to be used with -pF option)
* url.file.example an example of URL file, i.e. a list of URLs (to be used with -UF option)
* README some further informations

The script works as follow:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* calculate the list of files to be transferred (for example, extracting the iRODS path from the PID)
* activate the endpoints involved in the transfer in the following way 
* auto-activation (good for globusconnect)
** if not myproxy activation (if you have a myproxy server associated with your enpoint)
** if not local activation (which requires python-m2crypto package) and uses your local proxy
* delegate GO to do the transfer

Note 1 In datastagerconfig.py, iPATH (line 1) store the the path of the icommands, 
       like in the following line:  
iPATH='/home/jack/CINECA/GridTools/iRODS/iRODS/clients/icommands/bin/'

       In order to use datastager.py you should adapt it to your needed.

Note 2 In datastagerconfig.py, urlendpoint (around line 3) lists the 
       correspondence between GO endpoint and their url, like in the following 
       line:  

urlendpoint={'data.repo.cineca.it': "cinecaRepoSingl", 'irods-dev.cineca.it': "irods-dev"}
       In order to use datastager.py you should insert your correspondence between 
       GO endpoints and plain url inside or inform the developers. 

Usage
-----

See datastager -h 


Troubleshooting
---------------

Error
~~~~~
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/path/to/datastagerconfig.py'
Solution
~~~~~~~~
Copy datastagerconfig.py.example to datastagerconfig.py and edit it accordingly to your
system

Error
~~~~~
globusonline.transfer.api_client.ClientError: ClientError.NotFound (404
Not Found): Subtask details are not available for this task, use the
successful_transfers API instead.
Solution
~~~~~~~~
Upgrade your installation to, at least, release-2.0

Error
~~~~~
globusonline.transfer.api_client.ClientError: ClientError.AuthenticationFailed
(400 Authentication Failed): You must authenticate to this service using a signed
cookie from www.globusonline.org or an x509 certificate associated with your CLI
account and an x509 username cookie or header. If you just created your account,
your account may still be propagating, so please try again in a minute.
Solution
~~~~~~~~
Check that the public part of the proxy (usercert.pem) is associated in GO and
that you are using the right username (the one used to login to GO). 

Error
~~~~~
When using GC as endpoint the file does not exist.
Solution
~~~~~~~~
GC put the files in the home of the user so the path must be relative to that home
directory.
